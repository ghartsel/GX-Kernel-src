# Welcome to the *Core* microkernel

The Core microkernel is a supervisory space component that provides essential real-time services that meet the demands of todayâ€™s hard-deadline, embedded systems. It is the foundational component for implementing applications, device drivers, middleware, and a full-featured operating system.

The design emphasizes high run-time performance and reliability with consideration for robust system development and maintenance.

## Features

- *Preemptive Multitasking* scheduler for real-time responsiveness.

- Selectable *scheduling algorithm*: rate monotonic, earliest deadline first, round robin, timeslice

- *Multiple-instance* tasks.

- *Memory management* for protection and fault isolation.

- *Fault-tolerant* active fault detection and isolation.

- *C-language Interface* for high-level language support.

- *Layered architecture*:

    - Kernel
        - Task management
        - Resource mapping
        - IPC
        - device communication
        - IRQ handling
    - Service
        - UART
        - timer
    - Abstract
        - OS interface
        - application
        - driver
        - middleware    

## Set up

```
git clone git@github.com:ghartsel/Core.git
make setup
```

## Build and test Core (locally)

```
make clean
make core
cd bin
./core
```

## Develop applications with Core

See the [Core Programming Guide](http://gxkernel.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/index.html) to learn how to design, build, configure, and deploy an application built on Core.
